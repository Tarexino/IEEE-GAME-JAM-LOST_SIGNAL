## Story

The future was perfect.
Coffee made itself, cars flew, and everything ran smoothly on cheerful little particles called *quarks*. Then, something went wrong.

Out in deep space, at a research station called **Kessler-9**, the signal that kept quarks stable vanished. Now, appliances rebel, doors refuse to open, and security turrets attack anything that moves.

They needed a hero ‚Äî or at least someone with a mop.

Meet **Jolly**, the galaxy‚Äôs bravest janitor. Your mission is simple: clean up the mess, find the lost signal, and fix reality itself.
